    <h4>About me</h4>
    <p>I have been a fan of anime since feb 2020 and to talk to anime enthusiasts like me i started telegram.</p>
    <p>During those days of lockdown I joined various chat groups and met a lot of like minded otakus and by the end of 2020 we established our own community and as community we established many channels on telegram of anime , anime songs , wallpapers ,doujinshi......... all this promoted our community and brought many members.Soon we 1k members and were recognized by other anime communities and held promotional events related to anime......</p>
    <p>All was going well but in september 2022 our main group was banned together with some big channels due copyright infrigment. In the end me and my friends decided to take a break due to our now busy life and gave up on reviving it. </p>
